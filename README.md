What got me interested?
	At the start of this project I set out to understand more about what types of beer are rated highly and which are generally disliked by Beer Advocate members. I also wanted to modify the BA Top 100 for NY using data from the website in order to show highly rated beer of all types!
  
  Please see my presentation for my findings and adjustments.
